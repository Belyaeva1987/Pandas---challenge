The current analysis summarizes School and Student data. Upon analyzing the data different parameters were counted and outlined, such as: School Types, Total Students (per different schools), Total School Budgets, Per Student Budgets, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score,	% Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing, Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing). 
Based on the calculations the following conclusions can be made: 
•	Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) are Charter schools with smaller number of students; 
•	Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) are District schools with larger number of students;
•	School performance is better at smaller schools than at larger schools;
•	Charter Schools show better average results in reading, math, and overall passing than District schools.
